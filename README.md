### Summary:
- This assignment demonstrates rendering mySQL database using php. In here I loaded the customer database and you can click on the customer names and it will show more info onto a table. 

### Comments:
- Spent way too long on figuring out why isn't the customer info is echoing but me and Emil broke it down and figured it out!!
